/**
 * Class representing a 2D vector. A 2D vector is an ordered pair of
 * numbers (labeled x and y), which can be used to represent a number
 * of things, such as:
 * * A point in 2D space (i.e. a position on a plane).
 * * A direction and length across a plane. In three.js the length will
 *    always be the Euclidean distance (straight-line distance)
 *    from (0, 0) to (x, y) and the direction is also measured
 *    from (0, 0) towards (x, y).
 * * Any arbitrary ordered pair of numbers.
 *
 * There are other things a 2D vector can be used to represent,
 * such as momentum vectors, complex numbers and so on.
 * However these are the most common uses in three.js.
 *
 * Iterating through a Vector2 instance will yield its
 * components (x, y) in the corresponding order.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const a = new THREE.Vector2( 0, 1 );
 *
 * //no arguments; will be initialised to (0, 0)
 * const b = new THREE.Vector2( );
 *
 * const d = a.distanceTo( b );
 * ```
