/**
 * A class representing Euler Angles.
 * Euler angles describe a rotational transformation by rotating an object
 * on its various axes in specified amounts per axis, and a specified axis order.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const a = new Euler( 0, 1, 1.57, 'XYZ' );
 * const b = new Vector3( 1, 0, 1 );
 * b.applyEuler(a);
 * ```

   * then its Y axis and finally its Z axis. Other possibilities are:
   * 'YZX', 'ZXY', 'XZY', 'YXZ' and 'ZYX'. These must be in upper case.
   *
   * Three.js uses intrinsic Tait-Bryan angles. This means that rotations
   * are performed with respect to the local coordinate system.
   * That is, for order 'XYZ', the rotation is first around the
   * local-X axis (which is the same as the world-X axis),
   * then around local-Y (which may now be different from the world Y-axis),
   * then local-Z (which may be different from the world Z-axis).
